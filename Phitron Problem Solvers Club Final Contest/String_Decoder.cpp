Problem Statament

A special String Decoder that can decode strings encoded with a unique pattern. The encoding rule is as follows:

The string consists of lowercase English letters ('a'â€“'z').
Each letter is always followed by a single-digit number (0-9), which represents how many times that character should appear in the decoded string.
If a character is followed by 0, it is completely removed from the decoded string.
For example:

"a2b3c1" is decoded as "aabbbc".
"x1y0z2" is decoded as "xzz" (since 'y' appears 0 times, it is removed).
Your task is to implement the magical string decoder and decode a given encoded string.

Note - It is guaranteed that the resultant string will not be empty.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T (), the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a single string S (), representing an encoded string.
Constraints

Summation of  over all test cases doesn't exceed 
Output Format

For each test case, print the decoded string on a new line.

Sample Input 0

2
a2b3c1
x1y0z2
Sample Output 0

aabbbc
xzz
